			<h3>Shinji Ikari</h3>
			<p>Shinji Ikari is the main characters, the Third Child, the designated pilot of Evangelion Unit-01, and the only son of NERV Commander Gendo Rokubungi and Gehrin bioengineer Yui Ikari. Following the early death of his mother, who disappeared in a mysterious accident, his father entrusted Shinji to a guardian. Once Shinji reaches the age of fourteen, Gendo calls him back to the city Tokyo-3 to assume the role of Third Child, a pilot assigned to command the Eva-01. Because of his abandonment, Shinji feels unwanted and, according to Hideaki Anno, "abandoned the attempt to understand himself", convincing himself he is a useless individual. Anno also described him as shy of human contact and unable to commit suicide. Compared to the stereotypical hero of a traditional mecha anime, he is devoid of energy, closed towards others, and has a pessimistic attitude. After moving to Tokyo-3, Shinji begins to form relationships that influence him positively, especially the other pilots, his classmates, and other members of the Nerv such as Misato Katsuragi, his superior and legal guardian, and Ryoji Kaji. He is voiced by Megumi Ogata in the original Japanese dub while Spike Spencer voice Shinj in the ADV English Dub and Casey Mongillo voice Shinji in the Netflix English Dub.</p>
